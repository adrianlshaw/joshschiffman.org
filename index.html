My research interests include Operating System and virtualization 
security, trustworthy computing, and building verifiably secure 
cloud computing infrastructures. My current research focuses on 
distributed system security including application integrity and 
information flow security.  In particular, I have been examining how 
to ensure applications running on highly scalable virtualized 
infrastructures can be proven secure with respect to specific security and 
integrity criteria.  In the past I have 
researched trusted computing topics including ways of using the 
<a href="https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/groups/tpm/">Trusted 
Platform Module</a> (TPM) to report information flow policies and 
establish trust between machines on an Internet scale.  During my 
undergraduate program, I explored various research topics such as 
Artificial Intelligence and Spatial Databases.
